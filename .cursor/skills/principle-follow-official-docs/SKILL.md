# Follow Official Docs

Use a third-party library, platform, or service the way its official documentation prescribes.

Pick one option the current docs document, such as one supported auth method or their webhooks for async events. Follow that option. Read those docs before you integrate, and cite the page in the PR.

A bypass gets none of the behavior the docs attach to that option. Nothing reports the skip. If no documented option meets the need, stop and surface the tradeoff to the human. Leave the custom mechanism unbuilt.
